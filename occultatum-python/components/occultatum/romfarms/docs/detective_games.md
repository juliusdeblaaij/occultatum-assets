Way way back in 2017, I made a 
video that essentially asked... where are all the good detective games? I mean - sure, there are plenty of fun 
games where you play as a detective. Like The Wolf Among Us and Sherlock Holmes. But - in terms of the game mechanics - they never actually made me feel like I was 
doing any real detective work. For that, I had to dig much deeper. I'm talking about ancient PC artefacts, and obscure indie titles, and unfinished 
Itch.io demos, and bizarre FMV games. But! A lot can change in five years. Because since that video came out, we've 
seen an explosion of new detective games. At least one of them made in direct 
response to that original video! These new games have given 
me a whole new perspective on this design challenge - and 
they've made my old video... pretty much completely outdated. So it's time to do something I've 
never done on GMTK before - a sequel! A follow up? A re-do? Ah, 
whatever you want to call it. I'm Mark Brown. So - I played a bunch of 
detective games for this video. Everything from Disco Elysium to 
Judgment, and from Frog Detective to The Murder of Sonic The Hedgehog. All wonderful games, to be sure. But I was hunting for games that 
truly made me feel like a detective. And in my search, I realised that those 
titles fit into three different categories. I'm going to call them deduction-style games, contradiction-style games, 
and investigation-style games. Let's start with deduction-style games. And the ultimate example 
for this type of game is... ♫ Music ♫ Return of the Obra Dinn - Lucas Pope's 
1-bit murder mystery masterpiece. Okay, so in this game we're on board 
a 19th century merchant vessel where all 60 passengers are dead or otherwise missing. As an insurance inspector, our job is to fill out 
a log book by jotting down everyone's final fate. And to help with this, we can use a 
magic timepiece to transport ourselves to a freeze-frame vignette, showing the 
exact moment of each person's death. VOICE: "Captain! Open the door!" *Gunshot* From here, we can gather clues and 
information - including those final words of dialogue, and the 
accent they're spoken in. The location of each character, 
the outfits they're wearing, the objects they're holding, and so on. And we can then use these clues to 
answer the questions in the log book. So now we know that this 
guy was shot by the captain. But... who is he? Ah, well. You see, the clues alone won't 
always provide the answers we need. In fact, no where on this ship will we 
be directly told this person's name. So, instead, we'll have to deduce his identity by 
cleverly interpreting the other facts and clues. For this one, we will later hear the captain's last words - admitting that 
he shot Abigail's brother. From the crew roll, we know that 
Abigail's maiden name is Hoscut. And that there's a man on 
board with the surname Hoscut. Which means William Hoscut is almost certainly Abigail's brother - and our mystery 
man getting a face-full of buckshot. Bingo. Obra Dinn is not the only game that 
fits into this style, of course. There's also Case of the Golden Idol. Here, we also explore dioramas from 
the moment of some poor sap's death. We can read notes, rifle through people's 
pockets, and bounce between different rooms - before filling out these scrolls 
which detail the events of the murder. And in the upcoming Scene Investigators, currently available in demo form, 
we're let loose on a 3D crime scene. After rooting through this apartment 
we have to figure out the answers to five questions about the murder 
- and type them into a laptop. Plus, the game doesn't actually have to 
involve a murder - or any other crime. Take Riley & Rochelle, for instance. In this game we play as a documentarian 
who is making a movie about two musicians. We must pour through letters, notes, tapes, and vinyl records to figure out the 
exact date of some key documents. Ultimately, this deduction-style 
of gameplay can work in any kind of game where we must make sense of information - because while we might think of 
these titles as "detective games", they're really just logic puzzles. Reminiscent of some of the riddles 
in a Professor Layton game. We are given some information. And we have to answer questions 
about that information. But the only way to get to the truth is to 
perform various deductive reasoning tricks. So that might involve cross 
referencing multiple clues. We can establish this man's name by 
piecing together a surname on a poster, a first name on a pocket watch, 
and two initials on a score sheet. Or process of elimination. If we've named two of the 
midshipmen on board the Obra Dinn, then we can safely arrive at the third's identity. Or using inference and assumption. Whoever is sat in seat five at this party is 
the only one drinking juice instead of wine. And because Jake is referred to as a 
recovering alcoholic, it's probably his chair. The second type is the contradiction-style game. And for this, let's look at Lucifer Within Us. So we play as a digital exorcist, who is hunting down humans who have been 
tricked into doing a murder - by AI demons. Stick with it. In each crime scene we can interview a handful of witnesses and suspects - 
who share their testimony. Their recollection of the day is detailed in 
a nifty timeline at the bottom of the screen. We'll need to use these statements 
to figure out the killer - but if we simply take all of 
the testimonies at face value, we won't have what we need to close the case. And that's because... well, people lie. This guy, Abraham, says he was 
tending the bushes all morning. But that directly contradicts the testimony of 
Nerissa who says she spoke to Abraham first thing. So by presenting Nerissa's statement to Abraham, he'll fess up to his lie and amend 
his statement to give more detail. Do this to all the phoney statements and we'll finally have the evidence needed 
to accuse the correct killer. Now this is a pretty common style 
of gameplay in detective games. It's most famously seen in 
the Ace Attorney series, where we cross examine witnesses on the stand - and can present evidence that directly 
contradicts statements in their testimony. And it's also a big part of L.A. Noire. When interviewing witnesses we have to 
judge if each statement is truthful or not. Sometimes we have to rely solely on 
body language and facial cues - but we can also use cold hard evidence 
to prove that someone is lying. WOMAN: "Do I?
Would you like to prove that, detective?" This time, the gameplay isn't about logical deduction - it's more like 
playing spot the difference. Closer to something like Papers, 
Please, where we need to point out inconsistencies in each traveller's documents. So we have to carefully assess the 
veracity of each piece of information, and look for ways that it contradicts 
evidence that we know to be factual. Perhaps a suspect's alibi doesn't check 
out when compared to a CCTV recording. Or perhaps a witness's testimony needs to be amended because they 
misremembered a crucial detail. These contradiction-style games require a keen 
eye and a deep knowledge of all the facts. The final type is the investigation-style game. For this, let me show you a murder case in Shadows of Doubt - a detective game 
that's currently in early access. This is my victim: Kyra Brison. She was gunned down in the 
hospital where she works. Next to the body is a toy car - maybe 
the sick calling card of a serial killer? If so, it's a crucial clue because it has 
an unknown fingerprint on it: type BD. Now, in all of the games so far, the 
information we need is easily accessible. Perhaps spread across two or three screens. Or contained within the 
testimony of two or three people. If that was the case in Shadows of 
Doubt we'd have this case wrapped up in minutes - just find the 
person with the correct prints. But, in this game, there are 
slightly more than three people. In fact, the game takes place 
in a densely packed city block that is populated by literally 
hundreds of simulated citizens. They all have homes and 
jobs, partners and friends, shoe sizes, blood types, and fingerprints. Finding the owner of these BD 
prints is going to be... difficult. That's the crux of the investigation-style game. The game space is just impossibly large to 
wade through, and filled with red herrings. We could check the prints of every person 
in the city but it would take hours. So the real detective work comes from figuring 
out the best way to move through this mess. How can we find the needle in the haystack? So, back to my serial killer with BD prints - I check the surveillance cameras at the 
hospital and scrub through to the time of death. There's a suspicious man skulking about. I decide to ask Kyra's 
co-workers if they know him. I knock on every doctor's door and show the photo. No one knows his name, but I 
do keep getting the same info: he was seen at the Novak apartment block. Maybe he lives there? I break into the security room at Novak house and 
log into the resident database on the computer. I make a list of every man 
who lives in the building. Todney Ribbs, Johannes Young, Martin Peters, 
Nino Arquette, Arran Smith, and then... bingo. Oscar Nielsen. It's the man in the photo. I head up to his door. Check for prints on the handle. Bingo again - they're type BD. I knock on the door and then immediately cuff him. I check his pockets and find buckshot. I check his office. I find a shotgun. This is the one. I've found the killer. Of course, the challenge with making this type of 
game is that it requires a lot of content to work. You need all the dead ends and red herrings 
to, essentially, hide the real answer. Like, I always wished that LA Noire let me 
investigate the case for myself - but that would mean letting us explore every 
house and building in Los Angeles. So, sensibly, the game simply 
tells us exactly where to go. Now, Shadows of Doubt achieves 
the seemingly impossible by leaning heavily on procedural generation: it can magic up hundreds of 
other citizens in seconds, in order to obscure the true 
criminal amongst the masses. But the game doesn't have to be 
set in an actual city at all. And many titles in this investigation style use 
a massive database of information, or a fake internet, to construct an information space that 
is too big to check every nook and cranny by hand. So that includes Hypnospace Outlaw, where we must traverse a humongous 90s-style web 
portal to enforce a set of rules. Or the old Sherlock Holmes: 
Consulting Detective game, where the pertinent locations are hidden in a 
sea of red herring addresses in a phone book. And in Her Story, all of the information we need 
is contained in a database of 700-odd clips. But a clunky archive retrieval 
system makes it impossible to simply watch all of the clips 
in neat, chronological order. You might even consider Outer 
Wilds to be an investigation game. So in these games, we have 
to think critically about how to wade through this enormous set of clues. Perhaps we can look for leads in the information 
we do have, and figure out how to follow them - so in Her Story, we can search 
for terms mentioned in the clips, or make best guesses about what 
words might be spoken elsewhere. Wait, did she always have a 
tattoo? Let me search for that... We can also learn how the worlds 
are structured and organised. Knowing, for instance, that each home in Shadows of Doubt has a box with the 
occupant's birth certificate. Or that in Hypnospace Outlaw, 
it's possible to find hidden file archives on a secret server 
by typing in a special web address. Sometimes we even need to think in 
terms of not just space - but also time. In Outer Wilds we might need to be in 
a specific spot at a specific moment. And in Shadows of Doubt, we can go 
back in time with CCTV footage - or use a person's work schedule to find the 
perfect time to break into their home. So these three styles of game really capture 
distinct elements of the detective fantasy. Whether that's making logical deductions. Or interrogating a witness to unmask their lies. Or doing the more procedural side of police work. But we're missing one key moment - the big reveal, 
where the detective finally accuses the killer. So this usually crops up at some 
point during these detective games. Lucifer Within Us is primarily about spotting 
contradictions, but we're ultimately trying to find enough evidence to accuse a killer - and 
present the means, motive, and opportunity. Likewise, Shadows of Doubt will see us leading 
an in-depth investigation across the city - but we'll ultimately need to accuse someone, and 
present evidence that ties them to the murder. And we'll need to pick the correct killer as 
one of our deductions in Scene Investigators. But there are also games that make 
this accusation the primary focus. Take Paradise Killer. In this one, a man is on trial 
for allegedly murdering a bunch of council members... while 
being possessed by a demon. Okay, this again. As detective Lady Love Dies, we have 
to figure out who the real killer is. The gameplay involves exploring an open world 
island, hunting for clues, and interviewing a bunch of possible perpetrators with bonkers 
names like Doctor Doom Jazz and Crimson Acid. I guess it's technically an 
investigation-style game, but the gameplay is so straightforward when 
compared to something like Shadows of Doubt. But the real draw is the accusation. At any point during the game, we can decide that 
we have enough evidence to make a conviction. We enter the courtroom and make our 
case to the judge - picking the most likely perpetrator for each crime on the docket. We only get one shot at this, making 
for a dramatic, high stakes moment. And the game doesn't actually tell 
us if were were right or wrong in our accusation - so we'll just 
have to live with our decision. Or look it up on the internet. There's also Whispers in the West 
- a cowboy themed detective game. Once again, we conduct a simple 
investigation where we try to amass as much information as possible about 
the case - before making an accusation. This one ramps up the stakes by putting a 
ticking time limit on the evidence gathering - and it also lets us play in co-op with 
three other pals so we can confer, compare notes, and, uh, bicker about who 
has the best explanation for the crime. So these games capture every moment 
of a typical crime-solving case: gathering evidence, interrogating witnesses, following leads, making deductions, 
and accusing suspects of deadly crimes. But I don't think that's really 
what makes them detective games. Instead, it's that all three types of game ask you to think about information in 
the same way that a detective would. To be observant of your surroundings, and then to think critically about 
the clues and leads you find. Detectives are famous for 
their intellect and perception. Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 
has said that a detective has little more than "an alert acuteness of mind to grasp facts and the 
relation which each of them bears to the other." Basically - they're a smarty pants. And these gameplay structures 
make us feel smart too. But that only works if the 
designers are smart about how they ask the player to input their answer. What I mean by that is that pretty much 
every detective game needs some way for the player to prove to the game 
that they've figured something out. To prove that they spotted the 
connection or made the deduction. Some kind of "tester". And it's really easy to slip 
up here - and actually ruin the puzzle through the design of this tester. Like, let's go back to that moment in Obra 
Dinn where we had to figure out this mystery man's identity - and consider different ways 
of asking the player to provide their answer. Perhaps we could have our in-game 
investigator create an inventory of thoughts. Like "Captain shot Abigail's brother", "Abigail's maiden name is Hoscut", 
and "William's surname is Hoscut". Then the player can link these clues 
together to create a deduction. It's a nice gamified simulacrum of 
thinking - but it totally gives the puzzle away! If the player hadn't yet made 
the connection between Abigail and William... well they certainly will now. And if they had made that connection... putting it on screen like 
this can feel patronising, and discourage critical thinking in the future. Why bother if the game is 
going to do all the hard work? So perhaps we could ask the player a question, like "who is Abigail's brother", and then 
provide four possible choices to pick from. It's a really nice and simple way for the 
player to provide their answer... but again, it totally gives the game away. The text of the question spoils the line 
of thinking that the player should be on. And by providing just four answers, we can 
narrow our thinking to just these possibilities. Or just pick the most plausible from the list. Or just guess! And if we don't guess correctly, simply guess again until we 
brute force our way to victory. Obra Dinn does not do any of this stuff. Instead of providing leading 
questions that prompt the player, it asks the same generic 
questions for everyone on board: who are they and what is their fate? Instead of giving the player clues that 
they can combine and connect in a UI, it trusts players to write 
things down on a notepad - meaning it's up to them to 
figure out what's relevant, and how those facts can be 
interpreted or connected. And instead of giving the 
player a handful of choices, it lets them pick from any of the 60 crewmates 
- making it basically impossible to guess. And because we need to actually establish 
three correct fates before the game confirms our thinking, it's also impractical 
to brute force our way to victory. So in Obra Dinn, the design of the tester means we aren't prompted or led - and 
we can't guess or brute force. We have to figure it out for ourselves. And it's the same across most 
of these other detective games. In the deduction-style Riley & Rochelle 
we need to pick a complete date for each document - meaning that there's 
thousands of possible answers. You can't guess that. And in investigation-style games like Shadows 
of Doubt, the sheer size of the game space means its near impossible to just stumble 
upon the right place or person by chance - you need to run the investigation and make 
intentional choices about where to go - and when. And I think this is why contradiction-style games 
are usually my least favourite of the three, because you often can just 
tediously try every piece of evidence on every single statement 
until you uncover all of the lies. So. The design of these testers makes 
for games where players have to think about information like a detective - and 
the game won't move on until they do. Which can lead to a truly electric Eureka-style 
moment of satisfaction when you figure it out. But... it also means you're 
completely stuck if you don't. So let's look at how these games subtly - or not-so-subtly - assist 
players in their investigations. For one, the questions posed by the game are 
often extremely straightforward and specific. Like, during development, Golden Idol 
actually let players form full sentences to describe the events of the murder - but 
it was impossibly overwhelming to play. It was better, the devs found, to focus on 
much more clear and unambiguous questions. They shouldn't be leading - but 
they also shouldn't be vague. Two, these games ramp up in complexity over time. Riley & Rochelle starts with just a few notes 
and simple logic puzzles - but in later chapters we'll have to juggle loads of clues and figure 
out more complicated, multi-step deductions. Three, the games provide multiple 
avenues to reach the right answer. In Obra Dinn there are often 
multiple ways to deduce an identity, so you don't have to rely on one specific clue. In Shadows of Doubt, a killer can be 
traced in many different ways - from footprints to fingerprints to CCTV 
footage to telephone call history. And in Hypnospace Outlaw, if you 
can't figure out a clever way in, you can sometimes just farm for 
currency and pay to get access. Four, the games give players small victories, 
by giving step-by-step confirmations. In Golden Idol we get confirmation for every panel we figure out - rather than having 
to solve the entire case in one go. That would be a lot less manageable. Five, these games provide useful tools. Sometimes all we need is a notepad and pen, but 
I love the pinboard system in Shadows of Doubt. You can place any person, 
place, or object on the board, make connections with string, 
and even write custom notes. It makes investigations, like, 10 times more fun. Elsewhere, Her Story lets you tag footage and 
Hypnospace Outlaw lets you bookmark useful sites. And six, these games provide useful hints. Obra Dinn lets us know when we have access to 
enough information to fill in a character's fate. If we can't track a killer in Shadows 
of Doubt they'll eventually kill again, giving us more leads to follow. And in Golden Idol we can simply unlock written hints - as long as we can get through 
an intentionally-tedious mini-game. Now look: There are also some great detective games that 
don't really fit into these categories at all. Take, for instance, Overboard, which 
is a sort-of reverse detective game. You play as a murderer who has just offed her 
husband and now needs to falsify evidence, construct an alibi, and throw 
suspicion onto someone else. Or Silicon Dreams, a cyberpunk 
interrogation game where you're basically doing the Voight-Kampff 
test on a bunch of androids. You chat to these bots - but instead 
of looking for contradictions and lies, you're actually assessing their 
emotional response to your questions. And you can even manipulate their emotions 
to make the androids more talkative. If this bot isn't playing ball, maybe slap 
the cuffs on them to scare them straight. And what about Among Us? That's 
totally a detective game, right? But the killer is another 
player, and the team of detectives have to figure out who is telling the 
truth, and whose alibis don't stack up. So, the book is certainly not closed on the 
question "what makes a good detective game?". But in this video I hopefully showed 
one very effective way to do it. Basically - give the player clues and information. Ask them to think about it 
critically, by making deductions, looking for contradictions, forging 
connections, or making accusations. And then test them on their thinking 
in a way that doesn't prompt or lead the player - or allow for guessing or brute force. This will make players think like 
a detective - and have the same potent thrill of piecing together a mystery. But there could be many different 
ways to achieve that same goal. So maybe I'll come back in another five years 
and see how this genre has evolved by then.
